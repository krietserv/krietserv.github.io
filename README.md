## Kriet Project Page
A simple but beautiful page for the Kriet project. The background with blurred, semi-transparent circles that move creates a beautiful effect. It’s also worth mentioning the style, which I personally (as the creator) like. If there's something you don’t like, feel free to write on our Discord server in the **#report** channel under the **support** category with the tag **server(dev)**.

> It's worth noting that the Kriet project is now open for the second time.
